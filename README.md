This program asks questions to recommend you a fitting Science Fiction Movie.
There are 2 versions of this program. The best is called "sciFiMovieSelection.java", and has GUI. Meanwhile, I have added a less updated one that runs in the console called "sciFiMovieConsole.java".
The Console version only needs the one file "sciFiMovieConsole.java" to be run.
The Main GUI version needs "action.java", "info.txt", "move.txt", "questions.txt", "sciFiMovieSelection.java", and the img folder.
When running, the images need to be placed in a folder called "img". There will also be a "result.txt" file created which keeps your history of answering questions.
